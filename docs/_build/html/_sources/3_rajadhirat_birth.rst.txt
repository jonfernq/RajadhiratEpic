3. Rajadhirat's Birth 
=====================

The kingdom of Martaban was once again blessed with the birth of a royal heir. Binnya U, the Lord of the White Elephant, and his beloved queen Thiri Marlar welcomed a son into their family. The child, Basum Banset, was a stunning sight to behold. His round cheeks, button nose, and bright eyes made him the apple of his parents' eyes. However, it was the tiny mark on his tongue that set him apart from the rest.

As the young prince grew up, he was showered with love and attention by his family and subjects alike. His charming smile and infectious laughter could light up any room. But despite his playful nature, it was clear that Binnya Nwe was born to be a leader. Even as a child, he displayed an innate sense of wisdom and justice that belied his young age.

Meanwhile, other members of the royal family were also blessed with children. Hnin Am Po, one of the king's concubines, gave birth to a daughter named Talamithiri. The queen's sister, Sanda Devi, gave birth to another daughter, whom they named Talamidaw. Sadly, despite her position as queen, Sanda Minhla was unable to bear a son for the king.

However, not all was well within the kingdom. The governor of Pegu, Nyi Gaung Thain, had rebelled against the throne. Binnya U quickly mobilized his forces and led them into battle. In a fierce confrontation, Nyi Gaung Thain was captured and executed, and peace was once again restored to the land.

But amidst the chaos of war and politics, the people of Martaban found comfort in their royal family and the promise of a bright future under the leadership of their beloved prince, Binnya Nwe.
