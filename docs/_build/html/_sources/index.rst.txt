Note: Wikipedia Coverage 
------------------------

Existing Wikipedia article Razadarit Ayedawbon focuses only on the Burmese version
of this work. There are also Thai language, Mon language
and Pali language versions as well. The work can thus be characterized
as Transnational history, but since Wikipedia's historical coverage
is organized along the lines of the nation state, the nature of this work
is not adequately covered. This is an important issue because the longstanding
belief is that the original version of this work was in Mon, not Burmese,
and the version of this work in Thai is considered an important literary work
composed during the restoration of Rama I in Thailand.
